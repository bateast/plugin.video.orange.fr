## Disclaimer
This plugin is not officially commissioned/supported by Orange. It has not been tested with paid channel packs or from any other internet provider.

## Description
This addon brings Orange TV to Kodi. All channels included in your registration are now directly available from Kodi!


## Install
Download and install the ZIP archive directly into Kodi, then activate your preferred integration:
- [IPTV Manager](https://github.com/add-ons/service.iptv.manager): everything is handled automatically after activation
- Basic: simply pass the embedded .m3u and .xml files from the data folder to [IPTV Simple](https://github.com/kodi-pvr/pvr.iptvsimple)

## Support
As I'm very new to Python and Kodi, I'll try to do my best. Pull requests and suggestions are welcome. I have no idea if Orange offers the same functionnality outside of France, but I'd be happy to try something with some help and feedbacks!
