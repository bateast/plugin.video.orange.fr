## Description
This addon brings Orange TV to Kodi. All channels included in your registration are now directly available from Kodi!

## Installation
Download the latest [ZIP archive](https://github.com/BreizhReloaded/plugin.video.orange.fr/archive/master.zip) and install it into Kodi (Settings > Addons > Install from ZIP).

Integration to Kodi TV is handled via [IPTV Manager](https://github.com/add-ons/service.iptv.manager). Once installed on your system, channels and TV guide will be loaded automatically.

_NB: you can also choose the basic integration, in that case you need to manually pass to [IPTV Simple](https://github.com/kodi-pvr/pvr.iptvsimple) the .m3u8 and .xml files located within the data directory._

You should now be able to view all the channels grouped by category in the TV section. If that's not already installed, Kodi will ask you to install the decrypting tool when accessing a channel for the first time.

## Support
Bug reports or suggestions are more than welcome. I don't have any paid channels so I don't know what happens when watching Canal+ or beIN, feedbacks on this topic are welcome too. Feel also free to open a pull request!

## Known limitations and issues
This addons does not provide any catchup functionnalities, for that you can have a look at the great [Catch-up TV & More](https://github.com/Catch-up-TV-and-More/plugin.video.catchuptvandmore/).

Orange doesn't currently provide streams with different audio languages nor subtitles at the moment, so it's not available from this addon.
