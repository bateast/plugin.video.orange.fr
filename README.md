## Description
This addon brings Orange TV to Kodi. It currently provides a m3u file you can load into your PVR. Support for Kodi 19 Matrix is of course planned very soon.

## Install
For the moment, you'll have to clone this repo into your addon folder or download and install the ZIP archive directly.

## Support
As I'm very new to Python and Kodi, I'll try to do my best. Pull requests and suggestions are welcome. I have no idea if Orange offers the same functionnality outside of France, but I'd be happy to try something with some help and feedbacks!
